      <h1>An aurora</h1> (plural: auroras or aurorae),[a] also known as polar lights, aurora polaris, northern lights, aurora borealis,
      or southern lights, aurora australis, is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic).
      Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.
      Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind.
