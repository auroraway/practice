    <p>An aurora (plural: auroras or aurorae),[a] also known as polar lights, aurora polaris, northern lights, aurora borealis,
      or southern lights, aurora australis, is a natural light display in Earth's sky,
      predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic).
      Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.
      Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind.
      These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma.
      These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere).
      The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity.
      The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions,
      is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.
      Most auroras occur in a band known as the "auroral zone", which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude
      and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes),
      most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval",
      a band displaced by the solar wind towards the night side of Earth.</p>

    <p>Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations.
      Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and Sophus Tromholt (1881) in more detail,
      established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone.
      In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights.
      The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind.
      The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis
      and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.
      The aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.
      The aurora borealis is visible from being close to the center of the Arctic Circle such as
      Alaska, Canada, Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and Finland.
      A geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes.
      The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval")[5] is slightly different,
      being centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator
      when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun.
      The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.
      Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away,
      they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction.
      Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be subvisual.</p>
